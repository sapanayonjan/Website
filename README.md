# Website
This website is yet to be hosted.

This is a simple website designed with Sublime Text using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website is named Wander Lochan (meaning: eye that wanders). It includes blogposts and the photographical memoirs of some of the places I've been to and some I wish to be. Because my knowledge on programming languages is still vague, the website does not possess a professional look as it should, hence it seems generic. The website has not been hosted to any domain name.
